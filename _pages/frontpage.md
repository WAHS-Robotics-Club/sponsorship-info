## Our Mission
Our club's mission is to promote accessible STEM education in Central Virginia, and provide student-centered learning opportunities in engineering and design. We seek to develop the teamwork, organization, and leadership skills of the next generation. 
  
## FIRST
The First Tech Challenge (FTC), is an annual robotics competition in which teams build robots to compete in an alliance format against other teams. The objective of the competition changes annually, meaning teams design, build, program and test new robots each year. The challenge typically centers around constructing a dimensionally constrained robot, which expand vertically in order to acheive it objective, as well as perform other tasks. The program is built to foster professionalism, and works for the benefit of the communities nationwide. By participating in this competition, we not only learn technical skills such as Computer Aided Design (CAD) and coding but also develop leadership, teamwork, and organization. More information can be found at their website, [firstinspires.org](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc).

## Community
Engaging with our community is a vital aspect of our club's mission. This involves connecting with experts in the field to understand the real-world applications of our robotics skills, collaborating with other FTC teams to grow as builders, coders, and individuals, and working to inspire local interest in STEM.

At the WAHS robotics club, we participate in many events in order to spread STEM awareness, and create community engagement. One event we participate in is ClubFest, organized by the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Virginia. At ClubFest we showcased the club’s projects and interacted with many young technology enthusiasts. They enjoyed learning about our clubs robot and enjoyed watching it navigate around the festival. We think it's important to use our platform to spark interest in robotics from younger generations and this experience reinforced our commitment to community engagement and fostering future engineers.

Another excellent event we've had the good fourtune of attending is the annual CBIC Tech Tour, hosted by the Charlottesville Innovation Business Council (CBIC) and Piedmont Virginia Community College. During the CBIC Tech Tour we visited the UVA Medical Center and Link Lab, guided by the experts who worked their. At the Medical Center, we looked at some ways that advanced simulators are used to train medical students, including operating room simulators and ultrasound simulators. From the texture of the skin to the reaction to injected drugs, the simulations were hyper-realistic. At the Link Lab, we saw the development of a machine-learning algorithm allowing NAO robots to determine children’s emotions based on visual cues. The robots were a perfect example of robotics can be used to improve the world, and demonstrated how we might utilize the skills developed in the club after we graduate.

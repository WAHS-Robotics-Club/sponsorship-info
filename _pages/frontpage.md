## Our Mission
Our club's mission is to promote accessible STEM education in Central Virginia and provide student-centered learning opportunities in engineering and design. We seek to develop the teamwork, organization, and leadership skills of the next generation. 
  
## FIRST
The First Tech Challenge (FTC) is an annual robotics competition in which teams build robots and compete in an alliance format against other teams. The objective of the competition changes annually, meaning teams design, build, program, and test new robots each year. The challenge typically centers around constructing a dimensionally constrained robot, which must expand vertically to achieve its objective along with performing various other tasks. The program is built to foster professionalism and to benefit communities nationwide. By participating in this competition, our members learn skills such as Computer-Aided Design (CAD), coding, mechanical engineering, leadership, teamwork, and organizational abilities. More information about FTC can be found on their website, [firstinspires.org](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc).

## Community
Engaging with our community is a vital aspect of our club's mission. This involves connecting with experts in the field to understand the real-world applications of our robotics skills, collaborating with other FTC teams to grow as builders, coders, and individuals, and working to inspire local interest in STEM.

In order to engage with our community at the WAHS robotics club, we participate in many events across Central Virginia. ClubFest is an event organized by the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Virginia for groups to show off and attract new members. At ClubFest we showcased the club’s projects and interacted with many young technology enthusiasts. The attendees got to learn about our clubs robot and enjoyed watching it navigate around the festival. Part of our clubs mission is to create STEM interest in our community, and this experience reinforced our commitment to the goal of fostering future engineers.

This year we created a CAD (Computer Aided Design) class, for the students of the nearby middle school, something we hope to continue. Over 5 weeks, students learned the basics of the CAD software, Onshape, and were able to design their custom models and see them come into reality with our 3D printers. Our goal with the CAD class was to give the students a taste of what it's like to do engineering and to foster their interest in STEM subjects. Next year we plan to host the CAD class again, after the excellent success we had this year.

During WAHS with a Cause, we had an opportunity to interest 2nd grade classes in Crozet Elementary in robotics and engineering. Club members took the opportunity to explain the workings and development of our robotic, demonstrate the engineering process through use of Hot Wheels, and allow them to drive a robot through use of Spheros.

## Budget Breakdown
Below is an approximate breakdown of how we use the club's yearly income from sponsors. We need to spend a lot of money each year to build our robots, which unfortunately means that there is not much left over for improving and expanding. In particular, we hope that with an increased income, we'll be able to purchase invaluable tools, such as a CNC cutter, faster and more reliable 3D printers, and maybe someday a milling machine. Increased funds will enable us to purchase higher-quality parts, and expand our manufacturing capabilities, therefore enabling us to expand our reach and impact within our community by demonstrating higher-level robotics.
